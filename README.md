# Blockchain-Major-CryptoBox

This is our final major project on Blockchain. 

WHAT DOES OUR PROJECT DO?

So basically the website is divided into three parts mainly:

1. The first and the most important part where all transactions takes place. Currently we are only using Etherum currency but soon other curriences will work too.

2. The middle part shows all the features that our website provides.

3. The last part is the most entertaining part as it shows all the past transactions with a gif we have given in input as message. We use GIF Api key to access interesting gifs live.




HAPPY CODING !!!
